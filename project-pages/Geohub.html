          <div class="body-text">EPA's Superfund Redvelopment Program (SRP) has used the ArcGIS Online platform for over five years. In 2021, development on a hub site began as an effort to organize SRP's content and provide a usable interface to the public for accessing Superfund data, Superfund site-specific storymaps, apps and more.
             </div>
             <div class="body-text">This hub site became known as "the SRP Geohub". I was on the development team for this project in a training capacity. My colleague showed me the ropes on hub sites and together
              we developed a site that is now one of SRP's most popular web apps. The Geohub's custom HTML cards guide the public through a library of content developed under the Superfund Redevelopment Program. The Geohub also functions as an open data
              site, where users can search for publicly-available Superfund GIS data.
