          <div class="body-text">The Virginia Department of Energy maintains a database of landslide GIS features across the state. As a technician working for the Department's geology and mineral resources division, I spent many hours collecting these features by interpreting LiDAR-based DEMs, historical imagery and geologic maps.
            By the summer of 2020, I had learned about image classifications in my remote sensing course at UMW and wondered if it could be applied to DEMs, specifically for the identification of historical landslide features.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">The approach taken here did not yield the "easy button" I was looking for in landslide classification, but it was a good starting point for refining a process to automatically identify these features. There are several concrete next steps that
            would improve classification accuracy. These days, I think the growing availability of AI would significantly change the process.
